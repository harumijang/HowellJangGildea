1.  The reason we want to create this product is to create one singular place to find all the information that you might need about any given video game. IMDB has video game support, but the siteâ€™s features are highly catered towards movies. This means that most of the video game entries are underwhelming and missing information. One user type for the platform would simply be a consumer. Goals for this type of user could be to

	- Gain information about a recent release, including, cast, developer(s), release date, genre, ESRB rating, available platforms to play and buy, etc.
	- Leave a review for a recently played game to help other users who may be interested.

 The other type of user could be a developer. Goals for this type of user could be to

	-Post their game to the site to get the word out about it.
	-Get feedback from players on how to best improve the game or how to improve a future game.


2.  We plan to retrieve data from the RAWGS Video Game Database api and implements an advanced search to find information about any given genre, developer or title of a video game.  In addition, the user can find reviews from a specific video game. Users can sign up to the site and add video game reviews.  Developers can also upload game titles for users to review.  We also intend to potentially add other features, such as finding video games similar to selected video games.  


3. We intend to use RAWGS Video Games Database API that contains data for over 300,000 titles of video games on 50 platforms. It enables users to pull data such as publishers, developers, genres, description about the game and links to stores where users can buy the game.
